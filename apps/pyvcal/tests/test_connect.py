# "tutorial" for doing a sanity check on pyvcal
# 1) connect to a repo (is it there? do we need to authenticate?)
# 2) what's the head revision? (as a string, since this will be a 40-char
# hex string in git)

# for example:
# repo = repository(VCS.GIT, http://myrepo.com/)
# another_repo = repository(VCS.SUBVERSION, http://mysvn.com/)
