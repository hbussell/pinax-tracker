# Below is an example of a repository representation in YAML
#
# Any branch declarations will have branch set to None. If you anticipate you 
# will need to real branch, it is recommended that you skip the declaration here
# and define it in branches instead.

repository:
    path: http://www.somesvnpath.com/svn
    branches:           # optional
        - branch1
        - branch2
        - branch3
    revisions:          # optional
        - revision1
        - revision2
        - revision3

# Below is an example of a branch representation in YAML
branches:
    branch1:
        head: revision3
    branch2:
        head: revision1

# Below is an exmaple of revisions representation in YAML
revisions:
    revision6:
        predecessors:       # optional
            - revision5
            - revision4
        properties:
